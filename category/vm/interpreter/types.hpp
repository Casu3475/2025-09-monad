/**
 * This attribute changes the calling convention of the tail-called instruction
 * dispatch functions so that their pinned arguments are passed in different
 * registers to the usual SysV ABI. Doing so means that we perform far less
 * shuffling of arguments when making calls into the runtime: the non-tail
 * runtime function calls get to use the regular SysV registers, and must
 * preserve the registers used for argument threading.
 *
 * See https://blog.reverberate.org/2025/02/10/tail-call-updates.html for a good
 * reference to this technique. It is not supported by GCC as of version 15.
